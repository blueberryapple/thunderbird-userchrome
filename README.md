# thunderbird-userchrome
This `userChrome.css` file consist of fixes for the [TT DeepDark Thunderbrid Theme](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/tt-deepdark/) after changing to a larger font size; as well as some fixes for the search results where long links overflow and when the background colors aren't the correct dark colors. I'm probably in the very small minority that actually prefers larger font faces when browsing the internet and reading my emails. Whenever possible I use between 14-20px font sizes. Be it terminal, a code editor, a browser, or an email client. But sometimes, enlarging font sizes causes issues. 

## Usage
**if you aren't using the TT DeepDark theme this css file may make things look weird, you should probably modify it a bit**

Place this css file inside `$THUNDERBIRD_PROFILE_DIR/chrome`. Where `$THUNDERBIRD_PROFILE_DIR` is wherever your thunderbird profile is, since that is system dependent.
